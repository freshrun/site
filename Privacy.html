  <h1>FreshRun Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: October 2025</em></p>

  <p>FreshRun is designed to respect your privacy. This policy explains what information the app and its connected services collect, how it is used, and how it is kept secure.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>FreshRun itself does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data.</p>

  <p>The app uses the following information:</p>

  <p><strong>Location Data:</strong><br>
  Your deviceâ€™s location is used only to generate nearby running routes and, if you choose to start an activity, to track your run in real time.
  This information stays on your device and is never uploaded, shared, or stored on external servers by the app.
  Apple will ask for your permission before location access is enabled.</p>

  <p><strong>Network Data (via Cloudflare):</strong><br>
  When the app communicates with the FreshRun routing server, Cloudflare may temporarily log your IP address and basic device information (such as browser or OS type) for security and performance purposes.
  This is standard for all Cloudflare-protected services and is used only to maintain network reliability and prevent abuse.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All route and activity data you create in FreshRun is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
  It is not transmitted to or stored in the cloud.
  If you uninstall the app or reset your device, that data is deleted.</p>
  <p><b>If you have iCloud Backup enabled, your FreshRun data (such as saved routes or runs) may be included in your encrypted device backup managed by Apple.</b></p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>FreshRun uses the following services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple Maps / MapKit</strong> â€“ for map display and location search.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenRouteService (OpenStreetMap data)</strong> â€“ for generating running routes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services process requests only to provide mapping and routing functionality.</p>

  <p>Please review their own privacy policies for more details:</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can revoke location access at any time in your iOS settings.
  If location permissions are disabled, route generation will be limited to manual input.</p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact:</p>
