  <h1>FreshRun Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: October 2025</em></p>

  <p>FreshRun is designed to respect your privacy. This policy explains what information the app and its connected services collect, how it is used, and how it is kept secure.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>FreshRun itself does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data.</p>
  <p>The app only processes information necessary to provide its core functionality which is generating running routes and offering real-time navigation. This processing happens primarily on your device.</p>

  <p>The app uses the following information:</p>

  <section id="location-data">
    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>Your deviceâ€™s location is used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate nearby running routes.</li>
      <li>Track your run in real time when you start a Live Run.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information remains on your device and is not stored or shared by FreshRun.</p>
    <p>Apple will always ask for your permission before any location access is enabled.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="routing-requests">
    <h2>Routing Requests</h2>
    <p>When you request a route, the selected start and end points are sent securely to OpenRouteService (an open-source routing provider) to calculate the path.</p>
    <p>FreshRun does not store or log the route request, start point, or destination.</p>
    <p>OpenRouteService may temporarily process routing data to calculate your selected path, in accordance with their own privacy policy.</p>
    <p>All routing requests from FreshRun are securely relayed through our own routing server before reaching the OpenRouteService API. This means that OpenRouteService only receives the IP address of FreshRunâ€™s server â€” not your deviceâ€™s IP address. According to their policy, these server logs (which may include IP addresses) are retained for no more than 90 days and are used solely for security and service maintenance.</p>
    <p>FreshRunâ€™s routing server is protected by Cloudflare to ensure fast, secure, and encrypted communication between the app and our routing infrastructure. Cloudflare helps protect against unauthorized access, spam, and denial-of-service attacks. While Cloudflare may temporarily log IP addresses and basic connection data for security and performance purposes, this information is automatically deleted after a short period and is never shared, sold, or used by FreshRun for tracking or analytics.</p>
    <p>No personal information or identifiers (such as name, account details, or device ID) are ever included in these requests.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="in-app-navigation">
    <h2>In-App Navigation</h2>
    <p>When you start a Live Run, FreshRun uses your deviceâ€™s precise location and heading continuously to provide turn-by-turn voice guidance.</p>
    <p>This data is processed only on your device and is never transmitted or stored externally.</p>
    <p>During an active run, FreshRun temporarily uses background location so navigation can continue when the screen is locked. Background tracking ends automatically when your run finishes.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="reverse-geocoding">
    <h2>Reverse Geocoding</h2>
    <p>When you search for an address or drop a pin, Appleâ€™s built-in geocoding service processes that request to find street names and coordinates.</p>
    <p>FreshRun does not receive or store the contents of these lookups.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="network-data">
    <h2>Network Data (via Cloudflare)</h2>
    <p>When the app communicates with the FreshRun routing server, Cloudflare may temporarily log your IP address and basic device information (such as browser or OS type) for security and performance purposes. This is standard for all Cloudflare-protected services and is used only to maintain network reliability and prevent abuse.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="connectivity-checks">
  <h2>Connectivity & Server Status Checks</h2>
  <p>When you open the app or access certain features (such as viewing the About screen), FreshRun may send a small request to its server to confirm that the routing service is online and functioning correctly. These connectivity checks help ensure that route generation and related services work reliably.</p>
  <p>These requests do not include any personal data, location information, or identifiers. However, because they are routed through Cloudflare, your IP address and basic device information (such as browser or operating system type) may be temporarily logged by Cloudflare for security, performance, and abuse prevention. This data is automatically deleted after a short period and is never used by FreshRun for analytics or tracking.</p>
</section>


  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All route and activity data you create in FreshRun is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. It is not transmitted to or stored in the cloud. If you uninstall the app or reset your device, that data is deleted.</p>
  <p>You can erase all FreshRun data and preferences from your device at any time using the <strong>Clear All Data</strong> option in the appâ€™s About screen.</p>
  <p><strong>If you have iCloud Backup enabled, your FreshRun data (such as saved routes or runs) may be included in your encrypted device backup managed by Apple.</strong></p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>FreshRun uses the following services:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Apple Maps / MapKit</strong> â€“ for map display and location search.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenRouteService (by HeiGIT, based on OpenStreetMap data)</strong> â€“ for generating running routes.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> â€“ for secure and reliable network delivery.</li>
</ul>
  <p>These services process requests only to provide mapping and routing functionality.</p>

  <p>Please review their own privacy policies for more details:</p>

</ul>

  <h2>4. Transparency & Commitment</h2>
<p>FreshRun is built with privacy by design. We believe your data belongs to you, and that apps should be clear and honest about how information is used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>FreshRun contains no analytics, ads, or user tracking of any kind.</li>
  <li>No personal or location data is ever stored on external servers.</li>
  <li>You can clear all data and permissions at any time in the app settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we ever introduce new functionality that affects your data, this privacy policy will be updated, and you will be notified within the app.</p>


  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can revoke location access at any time in your iOS settings. If location permissions are disabled, route generation will be limited to manual input.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
